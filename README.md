# Sonic Grep

A version of grep, just written in Rust and much faster.
At least that's the goal. Polishing this while I learn more and more about Rust.
The initial setup is based on Chapter 12 of The Rust Programming Language.

### Ideas for what's next
1. Investigate how grep works and how to optimize it
2. Introduce concurrency w/ multiple workers to search big files faster.
3. Implement additional features (e.g. output line numbers)
